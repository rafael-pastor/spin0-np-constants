	abstract = {A study of the linearised gravitational field (spin 2 zero-rest-mass field) on a Minkowski background close to spatial infinity is done. To this purpose, a certain representation of spatial infinity in which it is depicted as a cylinder is used. A first analysis shows that the solutions generically develop a particular type of logarithmic divergence at the sets where spatial infinity touches null infinity. A regularity condition on the initial data can be deduced from the analysis of some transport equations on the cylinder at spatial infinity. It is given in terms of the linearised version of the Cotton tensor and symmetrised higher order derivatives, and it ensures that the solutions of the transport equations extend analytically to the sets where spatial infinity touches null infinity. It is later shown that this regularity condition together with the requirement of some particular degree of tangential smoothness ensures logarithm-free expansions of the time development of the linearised gravitational field close to spatial and null infinities.},

The main objective of this analysis is to understand the effects of the non-linearities of this system on the regularity of solutions and polyhomogeneous expansions at null infinity and, in particular, at the critical sets where null infinity touches spatial infinity. The main outcome from our analysis is that the nonlinear interaction makes both fields more singular at the conformal boundary than what is seen when the fields are non-interacting. In particular, we find a whole new class of logarithmic terms in the asymptotic expansions which depend on the coupling constant between the Maxwell and scalar fields. We analyse the implications of these results on the peeling (or rather lack thereof) of the fields at null infinity.},

	abstract = {It is shown that a large class of systems of non-linear wave equations, based on the good-bad-ugly model, admit formal solutions with polyhomogeneous expansions near null infinity. A particular set of variables is introduced which allows us to write the Einstein field equations in generalized harmonic gauge as a good-bad-ugly system and the functional form of the first few orders in such an expansion is found by applying the aforementioned result. Exploiting these formal expansions of the metric components, the peeling property of the Weyl tensor is revisited. The question addressed is whether or not the use of generalized harmonic gauge, by itself, causes a violation of peeling. Working in harmonic gauge, it is found that log-terms that prevent the Weyl tensor from peeling do appear. The impact of gauge source functions and constraint additions on the peeling property is then considered. Finally, the special interplay between gauge and constraint addition, as well as its influence on the asymptotic system and the decay of each of the metric components, is exploited to find a particular gauge which suppresses this specific type of log-term to arbitrarily high order.},
