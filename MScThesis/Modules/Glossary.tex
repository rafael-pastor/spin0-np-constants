% The definitions can be placed anywhere in the document body
% and their order is sorted by <symbol> automatically when
% calling makeindex in the makefile
%
% The \glossary command has the following syntax:
%
% \glossary{entry}
%
% The \nomenclature command has the following syntax:
%
% \nomenclature[<prefix>]{<symbol>}{<description>}
%
% where <prefix> is used for fine tuning the sort order,
% <symbol> is the symbol to be described, and <description> is
% the actual description.
